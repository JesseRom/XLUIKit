# XLUIKit
The function extension of the common system UI object is organized in the form of catogry, which is convenient to use. For example, UIView's screen capture operation, UILabel specifies the range of font color settings, color gradient UIImage acquisition, and so on. It is designed to provide some methods that are closer to the application scenario and improve work efficiency.
